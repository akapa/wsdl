##What's this

A library to communicate with WSDL/XSD based webservices. Through XSLT, it helps you create Javascript definitions from the WSDL and XSD files, and then you can simply create Javascript objects defined in the XSD, call the methods defined in the WSDL and receive XSD-defined Javascript objects back from the server.

##Requirements

Defined in a [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) format, so you need an AMD loader.

Uses: 
 - [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/)
 - Some of my own projects: [kapa-xml](https://github.com/bazmegakapa/kapa-xsd), [kapa-objTools](https://github.com/bazmegakapa/), [kapa-Library](kapa-Library).
